# Using Particle's Photon and three low-cost Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) to implement a finite-state machine that detects pedestrians crossing a relatively busy sidewalk 

Particle's [Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi/) is small and powerful wifi-connected micontroller capable of basic to advaced telemetry when interfaced with sensor units. To demonstrate the use of Photon as an MQTT client, the microcontroller was interfaced with the Bosch Sensortec Intergrated Environmental Sensor Unit _BME280_. To make the unit readily accessible, a breakout version from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652) was obtained. 

The scope of this project comprised setting up the microcontroller to report telemetry data in the form of the count and direction of crossings as determined by the state-machine to the [AT&T M2X](https://m2x.att.com/) service. AT&T M2X provides time-series data storage, device management, message brokering, event triggering, alarming, geo-fencing, and data visualization for industrial Internet of Things (IOT) products and services.
